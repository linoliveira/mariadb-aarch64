# MariaDB Docker image for AArch64

This is the same image of [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) but replacing the [x86 Debian Jessie](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) for the [AArch64 version of Debian Jessie](https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/debian/) and using the MariaDB images from the Debian repository instead of the third party ones used in the [official MariaDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) to allow for AArch64 compatibility.

Please refer to the [official MariaDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) for usage instructions.
